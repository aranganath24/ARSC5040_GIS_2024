aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Introduction</h2><p>A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a digital platform that facilitates the visualization and analysis of spatial data (i.e. georeferenced data that contains explicit information about where attributes of interest are located on the earth’s surface). The specialized software, analytical principles, and empirical techniques that comprise Geographic Information Systems are now used in virtually every applied discipline across the physical and natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences.</p><p>Over the course of our five weeks together, we will explore some of the ways GIS is used in the social sciences. In particular, our goals for the course are to survey existing social scientific scholarship that uses spatial data and GIS methods; encourage you to formulate spatial research questions of your own, or think about how the methods and concepts used in spatial social science might enrich your existing work; and provide you with hands-on experience in working with spatial data and basic GIS methods, with a view towards building a foundational knowledge base that can serve as a starting point for more specialized future exploration.</p><p>Given the short time frame of the course, we must necessarily be selective about which topics to cover. Important topics that would be included in a longer course, such as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/15410064/2018/62/1">critical or speculative approaches</a> to spatial research are omitted for lack of time, but the material we do cover will hopefully allow you to engage productively with these different traditions of scholarship in the future. In addition, while geostatistics and spatial econometrics play an important role in GIS analyses in the social sciences, our course will not explicitly cover these topics. That is because they are presented in another ITSS mini-course, <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cartss/interdisciplinary-training-social-sciences-itss/mini-course-modeling-temporal-and-spatial-processes">Modeling Temporal and Spatial Processes in the Social Sciences</a>, which frees up time for us to explore other material that is not covered elsewhere in the ITSS curriculum. You are encouraged to enroll in that course when it is next offered, as a complement to this one.</p><h2 id="course-materials-and-software"> <a href="#course-materials-and-software" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="course-materials-and-software"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Course Materials and Software</h2><p>There are no materials for purchase. All relevant learning materials will be distributed (via this website) to you over the course of our 5-week session.</p><p>We will primarily work in R Studio, which is a development environment for the open-source R programming language. We will work with a variety of GIS and data science packages/libraries, and you will be given guidance about which packages to install and load as we move through the term.</p><p>If you don’t already have R and R Studio installed on your computers, please install both applications (which are free of charge) before the start of the first class. You can find instructions on how to install R and R Studio on this <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/setup.html">page</a>; make sure to follow the instructions that correspond to your operating system. The course does not require any previous experience with R/R Studio, and if you are new to R, rest assured that it is fairly intuitive and you will be able to pick things up as we go. However, if you would like a brief primer on working in R Studio, this <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/">tutorial</a>, which takes about 4 hours to complete, would be a good place to start.</p><p>In Class 4, we will introduce you to <a href="https://earthengine.google.com/">Google Earth Engine</a>. GEE is free for academic researchers and students, but requires registration, and this process can take up to a week. Please start the registration process well in advance of Class 4 (April 21), so that you have access to the platform by the start of that class. To register, go to the website for the Earth Engine <a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/">code editor</a>, sign in with a Gmail account, and follow the instructions. The registration process will likely go faster if you register using the Gmail account tied to your CU-Boulder email address, rather than a personal Gmail account (since this will allow Google to quickly verify that you are affiliated with an educational institution).</p><h2 id="communication-and-office-hours"> <a href="#communication-and-office-hours" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="communication-and-office-hours"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Communication and Office Hours</h2><p>I am available by email, and encourage you to contact me in between classes if you have questions about the course material or problem sets/assignments. I will also hold office hours (on Zoom) on Tuesdays and Fridays from 4:00 to 5:30 pm. If you would like to meet, but these times are not compatible with your schedule, please email me, and we can set up an appointment. Please note that I do not check email during the weekends.</p><h2 id="topicsmodules"> <a href="#topicsmodules" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="topicsmodules"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Topics/Modules</h2><p>The following is a brief outline of our five class modules.

If you are unfamiliar with R Markdown, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIlzQpXlJNk">presentation</a>, by Garrett Grolemund, is an excellent primer. Please also feel free to see me in Office Hours, and I can help you to get your R Markdown files set up. While you’re encouraged to use R Markdown, it is not required, and you are welcome to write up your assignments in a manner of your choosing (provided I can clearly see your code and code outputs).</p><p>Assignments are graded Pass/Fail.</p><h2 id="final-project"> <a href="#final-project" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="final-project"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Final project</h2><p>In addition to the assignments, you must submit a final project, which is due by <strong>Wednesday, May 4, at 11:59 PM</strong>. On our final day of class (<strong>April 28</strong>), you will give a brief (~7 minute) “lightning talk” on your project-in-progress, which will allow us to all learn from each other (and perhaps help you identify opportunities for future collaboration with your classmates).</p><p>See below for various project options. The goal of the projects is to give you an opportunity to make progress on a project that will yield some tangible benefit to you in the future (i.e. a publication, a lesson plan, a dataset etc.).</p><p>A word of advice: The final project should be a challenging and rewarding experience, but given time constraints, it is important not to overwhelm yourself (and GIS projects have a way of quickly becoming complicated and overwhelming, even if they did not seem so at first). If you find yourself getting overwhelmed, please talk to me, and we can find a way to recast the project to keep your workload manageable.</p><p><em>Option 1: Replication Exercise</em></p><p>Identify a research paper in your field of interest that uses GIS in its empirical analysis, and replicate one aspect of its GIS analysis. In your discussion, provide the code you used to replicate the published analysis, and discuss whether the results did indeed replicate as expected. If not, briefly speculate about why you think that’s the case. If you can think of a quick way to extend the paper’s analysis, please implement that extension and discuss your results.</p><p><em>Option 2: Research Proposal</em></p><p>Identify a research question in your area of interest that can be addressed using GIS data, and propose a research design that will allow you to answer it. In your discussion, clearly state the question, briefly discuss how other scholars have explored it in the past, and explain how the use of GIS and spatial data will allow you to extend the research frontier. You should discuss data sources and your empirical strategy, but you are <strong>not</strong> required to do the actual research (but you are welcome to do so, or conduct a quick plausibility probe, if you wish!)</p><p><em>Option 3: Tutorial</em></p><p>Our course provides a very general overview of GIS and various geospatial tools, but scratches the surface of the many geospatial methods that could be useful to social scientists. Identify a tool or technique that we did not cover, and write a brief tutorial about how to use that tool or technique; the tutorial should be accessible to someone who has completed this mini-course. Think of this project option as an opportunity to teach yourself a method that could be useful for your research, but which we did not cover in the course (or as an opportunity to develop a lesson plan that could could enhance your teaching portfolio).</p><p><em>Option 4: Add a GIS component to an existing working paper</em></p><p>Many of you will have works-in-progress (either papers or thesis/dissertation chapters) that do not currently incorporate GIS, but might benefit from doing so. Take a working project (it is fine for the working project to be co-authored with someone outside the class), and add a GIS component to it. If your idea for how to use GIS in the working paper cannot feasibly be implemented in the time you have available, write up the “methods” section of the paper that describes the data and methods you will use. If the data requires an original data collection effort, please describe your strategy for collecting this data. Please submit the entire paper, with the GIS component embedded within it.</p><p><em>Option 5: Create (or propose) a new dataset</em></p><p>While taking this course, and exploring the various geospatial datasets that are available, you may develop ideas about new datasets that could be useful to your scholarly community, and which might incorporate variables that are created using GIS methods or tools. Create (or, if you do not have sufficient time, propose) a novel dataset along these lines. In your writeup, discuss how you created it (or would go about creating it, if it is a proposal), and explain what sorts of questions such a dataset could help to answer, and how it would extend the research frontier in your field.</p><p><em>Option 6: Project of your choice</em></p><p>You are welcome to define and create a project of your choice, if you have an idea that does not fall within these options. If you decide to do so, please run your idea by me beforehand.</p><h2 id="final-grades"> <a href="#final-grades" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="final-grades"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Final Grades</h2><p>Final grades will be determined as follows.</p><ul><li>Assignments (30%)<li>Attendance and Class participation (30%)<li>Final Project and Lightning Talk Presentation (40%)</ul><h2 id="accomodations-for-disabilities"> <a href="#accomodations-for-disabilities" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="accomodations-for-disabilities"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Accomodations for Disabilities</h2><p>“If you need accommodations for a disability, it is recommended that you submit an accommodation letter from Disability Services.
