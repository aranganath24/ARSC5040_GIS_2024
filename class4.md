## Overview

In this session, we will begin with a discussion of geospatial data ethics, and think about the distinctive ethical issues that might arise in the context of working with GIS data. Then, we'll introduce basic concepts and tools related to satellite imagery and remote sensing, and explore some social scientific applications of this data. The in-class exercise will focus on getting you acquainted with Google Earth Engine, which is a platform for extracting and analyzing remotely sensed data. To that end, please make sure you've been approved for Google Earth Engine access by the start of class (the process can take up to a week). More details on gaining access to GEE are available on the syllabus, under the section on "Course Materials and Software".

## Class Notes/Tutorial

* [Class 4 slides](class_notes/class4/rs_presentation/rs_gee_presentation.html) 

## Useful resources

* There are a number of very good video tutorials on using Google Earth Engine. The best place to start is this [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAElakLgCdA), presented by Stace Maples of the Stanford Geospatial Center.
* If you plan to do a lot of work with Earth Engine, and you are more comfortable using R than using JavaScript, you should checkout the newly developed [RGEE](https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee) package, which allows you to work with GEE data (and leverage the platform's computational resources) from your desktop's R Studio application. It can sometimes be a little challenging to install, but once it's set up, it's very nice to work with.  I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fDhRL_LBdQ) to be a helpful RGEE installation guide. Looking through this  [repository](https://csaybar.github.io/rgee-examples/#Introduction) of RGEE scripts is a great way to start learning the RGEE package. 
* The official Google Earth Engine [documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides) page contains a number of useful guides and tutorials. 

## Assignment

There is no assignment for next class; please make sure to prepare a brief presentation on your final project, to be delivered next class.
