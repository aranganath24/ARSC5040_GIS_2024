# Introduction

A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a digital platform that facilitates the visualization and analysis of spatial data (i.e. georeferenced data that contains explicit information about where attributes of interest are located on the earth's surface). The specialized software, analytical principles, and empirical techniques that comprise Geographic Information Systems are now used in virtually every applied discipline across the physical and natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences. 

Over the course of our five weeks together, we will explore how GIS is used in the social sciences. In particular, our goals are to survey existing social scientific scholarship that uses spatial data and GIS methods; encourage you to formulate spatial research questions of your own, or think about how the methods and concepts used in spatial social science might enrich your existing work; and provide you with hands-on experience in working with spatial data and basic GIS methods, with a view towards building a basic knowledge base that can serve as a starting point for more specialized future exploration.  

Given the short time frame of the course, we must necessarily be selective about which topics to cover. Important topics that would be included in a longer course, such as [critical or speculative approaches](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/15410064/2018/62/1) to spatial research are omitted for lack of time, but it is our hope that the material we do cover will allow you to engage productively with these alternate traditions of scholarship in the future. In addition, while spatial statistics and econometrics play an important role in GIS, our course will not explicitly cover them, largely because these topics are presented in

The course has two main goals. First, it aims to familiarize you with basic GIS tools and methods, with a view towards empowering you to deploy spatial visualization and analysis in your own research projects. Second, and more broadly, it aspires to introduce you to "spatial social science" as an exciting and substantive interdisciplinary research agenda, one that develops spatially informed theories or hypotheses, and leverages spatial data, to better understand human behaviors, interactions, and institutions. By working through the course material, you will gain experience
