## Overview

In this session, we will cover vector data (which we were introduced to in the previous session when working with a spatial dataset of country boundaries) more explicitly, and explore the different ways it can be manipulated and analyzed, and the different ways it can be used to inform our understanding of social phenomena. We will also explore some of the practical considerations to keep in mind when working with map coordinate systems. The in-class exercise will give you some practice in carrying out basic vector data operations in R Studio.

## Assignment

Please choose **one** of the options below and turn it in before the start of Class 3. 

*Option 1*

Explore some of the vector datasets discussed in the [General Resources](/resources.md) section of the course webpage. Find a polygon dataset, and a point dataset (or a tabular dataset that is geocoded), and implement a spatial join to derive a new dataset that contains information on the number of points within each polygon. What research questions might the dataset you generated help to answer? 

*Option 2* 

Go to this [archive](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/) of police stop data, provided as part of the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/). Under the "CO" heading on this [page](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/), download the "Aurora"" data as a CSV file. Read this file (which contains lat/long coordinates for most of the stops in the dataset; assume that the coordinate reference system for these lat/long coordinates are EPSG: 4326) into R Studio, and generate a new dataset that contains information on the total number of police stops which took place in each census tract. 

Document your steps/code, and send me the final dataset (i.e. the tract-level dataset on the number of stops) that you generated as a CSV file.
